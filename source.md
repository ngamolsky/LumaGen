# The Wordpress vs WP Engine Drama

In a surprising twist of events, the open-source giant WordPress is entangled in a dramatic controversy surrounding its licensing policies aimed squarely at WP Engine, stirring fierce discussions across the web. **"How can you expect any goodwill towards open-source from a community when you insist on enforcing fees?"** This quote captures the mounting frustration many in the tech community feel as these events unfold.

**Background Context**  
WordPress, an open-source content management system, has thrived on its community-driven model for years. However, recently, the organization faced backlash due to new licensing fee structures selectively impacting WP Engine, a leading managed Wordpress host. This move has raised concerns among other hosting companies and developers about potential instability and implications for open-source projects.

**The Emergence of Tension**  
The friction began to surface as Automattic, the parent company of WordPress, targeted WP Engine for allegedly not contributing enough to the WordPress ecosystem. **James Ivings** pointed out in one of his tweets, _"You can't go IPO with just a happy customer base, you need to be extracting profits from the entire market (via licensing)."_ This sentiment echoes the belief that the motives behind the licensing changes extend beyond simply supporting the open-source initiative.

**Mixed Reactions Among Developers**  
As the news broke, reaction from the community was polarized. While some developers supported Automattic's actions as a means to ensure sustainable growth, others voiced concerns about stifling innovation and creating a hostile environment for open source. One developer remarked that experienced consequences, like **"Being blocked from installing plugins,"** could negatively impact WP Engine's customer base and, subsequently, WordPress's reputation as a stable and reliable platform.

**The Financial Perspective**  
Conversations centered around revenue models emerged, as seen in **Danny Postmaa's** reflections on his experiences, _"more growth != more support tickets."_ He noted that despite their expanding user base, support requests remained steady, indicating a deeper complexity in managing resources amid growth.

While the turmoil has pushed various developers to share their thoughts online, there's a palpable sense of disbelief among users and developers alike. The unforeseen changes raise questions about open-source integrity, As **Arvid Kahl** noted, emphasizing the need for transparency from Automattic in their reasoning. _"I hope the ecosystem is self-healing. I just hope WPE being blocked from installing can be healed without causing massive reputational damage,"_ he expressed. ([source](https://twitter.com/arvidkahl/status/1839445536686174387))

# DHH vs Vercel

The drama between David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) and Vercel revolves around several themes, but it hasn't been explicitly detailed in the form of a direct confrontation or a singular event labeled as "drama." Instead, it's characterized by DHH's critical stance on various tech industry practices, which tangentially involve or critique elements associated with Vercel's ecosystem, particularly around developer tools, cloud services, and the broader implications of tech trends.

Themes of the Drama:

Criticism of Modern Development Practices: DHH has been vocal about what he perceives as unnecessary complexities in modern web development, often citing Next.js (a Vercel product) as an example of frameworks that complicate rather than simplify development. His advocacy for simpler, more direct tools like Hotwire over more complex frameworks indirectly critiques the direction where companies like Vercel are heading with Next.js.
Cloud Services and Financial Models: There's an underlying critique of cloud services, which Vercel heavily utilizes and promotes. DHH has expressed skepticism towards the financial models of cloud computing, suggesting they're often overpriced for what they deliver, a model that benefits companies like Vercel.
Security and Performance: While not directly part of the drama, Vercel's boast about neutralizing a massive DDoS attack might be seen in the context of this ongoing debate about where development and hosting should prioritizeâ€”performance, security, or ease of use at potentially higher costs.

Relevant X Posts (Summarized):

DHH on Competence and Open Source: DHH has recently discussed the importance of meritocracy in open source, which could be interpreted as a broader commentary on how tech companies operate, possibly including how Vercel positions itself in the developer community.
Vercel's Security Claims: Vercel highlighted their capability to handle security threats, which contrasts with debates around whether such robustness justifies the shift towards cloud-based, service-heavy solutions that DHH often criticizes.
General Critique of Tech Trends: DHH's posts often touch on themes like the exploitation of developer insecurities for market growth, which indirectly touches on the business models of companies like Vercel that offer developer tools and platforms.

This "drama" isn't characterized by a direct, heated exchange but more by DHH's ongoing critique of industry trends, which Vercel, through its products and business model, embodies. While there's no specific event pinpointed as "the drama," the underlying tension lies in differing visions for software development: one where simplicity and direct control are championed (DHH's perspective) versus embracing complex, integrated solutions (more aligned with Vercel's approach).
