Really, WordPress? \n\nThe community\u2019s got mixed feelings\u2014like that time you tried pineapple on pizza. Some folks are team Automattic, thinking this'll keep things sustainable. Others? They\u2019re worried about blocking plugins and killing the vibe for innovation. \n\nTech insiders are shaking up their revenue models. Check out NewFoldDigital who've got everyone buzzing about licensing strategies. The fear? An escalation of fees\u2014oh joy. \n\nDespite the chaos, developers are fingers-crossed that WordPress doesn\u2019t shoot itself in the foot and cause a major reputation fallout.
